Let $A$ be a natural number with $2^n$ digits, all of which are equal. Show that $A$ has at least $n$ distinct prime factors.


\item %
Let $A$ and $B$ be two points in the plane with distance $1$ between them.
Find the maximum length of a path from $A$ to $B$, comprising at most $n$ straight line segments, with the property that at every point along the path (not only at the endpoints of the segments) as one moves from $A$ to $B$ the distance to $B$ is reducing.
