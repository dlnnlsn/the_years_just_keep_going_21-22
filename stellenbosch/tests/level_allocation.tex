This test consists of four sections with five questions each.
Each question is multiple-choice with five possible answers of which exactly one is correct.
Each question is worth $1$ mark; an incorrect answer or a blank response will be awarded $0$ marks.
No calculators or external resources may be used; a ruler and compass is allowed however.
Your answers must be submitted in the provided Google Form.

This test will only be used to decide which lectures at the camp you will gain the most from, and will not be taken into account beyond that.
