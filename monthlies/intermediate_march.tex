\item %Austria 2019 Junior Regional
Let $p$, $q$, $r$ and $s$ be prime numbers satisfying
$$5 < p < q < r < s < p+10$$
Prove that the sum of these four prime numbers is divisible by $60$.


		
\item %Argentina 2018
Phil writes the numbers $1$ to $27$, in some order, around the circumference of a circle. 
He then calculates the sum of each pair of adjacent numbers, thus obtaining $27$ sums. 
We call $A$ the largest of these sums and $B$ the smallest. 
\\ Find the minimum possible value of $A-B$.
\\ Show how Phil can write these numbers to obtain that minimum value and explain why it is
not possible to obtain a smaller value.


\item % Kazakstan 2008
Find all real numbers $x_1$, $x_2$, \ldots, $x_{2021}$ such that
\[ (2022-x_1)^2 +(x_1-x_2)^2 +(x_2-x_3)^2 +\dotsb +(x_{2020}-x_{2021})^2 +x_{2021}^2 = 2022. \]~


\item %Turkey Junior 1999
Let $\Gamma$ be a circle with centre $O$ and radius $1$.
Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on $\Gamma$ such that $AB \parallel CD$ and $AB$ is a diameter of $\Gamma$.
Let $l$ be the line through $A$ tangent to $\Gamma$ and let $BC$ and $BD$ intersect $l$ at $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
Find $|AX| \cdot |AY|$.


\item %Finland 2009
For which $z \in \mathbb{Z}$ does there exist a polynomial $P$ with integer coefficients such that $P(2021) = 2022$ and $P(z) = z$?


\item % Centroamerican 2018
Liam and Dylan play a game, alternating turns with Liam playing first.
At the start, there is a pile of $1 +2 +\dotsb +2022$ stones.
On his turn, a player chooses a positive integer $n$ between $1$ and $2022$ inclusive such that neither player has previously chosen this $n$.
He then removes $n$ stones from the pile and keeps them next to him.
Once the pile is empty, the winner is the player with an even number of stones next to him.
Who has the winning strategy?
