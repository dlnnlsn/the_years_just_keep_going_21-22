\item % Jean?
Find all functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that
\[ f(x^{2020} +2020y) = f(x^{2021} +2021y) +f(x^{2022}) \]
for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.

We call a solid tetrahedron that has all side lengths $1$ a \emph{unit tetrahedron}.
Consider a unit tetrahedron $T$ in space.
We want to place more unit tetrahedrons around $T$ such that each additional tetrahedron has one of its faces overlapping partially with one of the faces of $T$ (the overlapping region must have positive surface area), and such that the interiors of the tetradehra are not allowed to overlap.
What is the maximum number of additional unit tetrahedra one can place around $T$?
(Points for this problem will be awarded according to how many tetrahedra you are able to place around $T$.)
