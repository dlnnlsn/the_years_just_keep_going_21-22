Problem statement


\item % Bangladesh 2011
$n$ teams participate in a round robin soccer tournament, in which each team plays each other team exactly once. Each team starts the tournament with $0$ points. A team gains $3$ points for every match they win, and $1$ point for every match they draw. However, they lose $1$ point for every match they lose. At the end of the tournament, the sum of the number of points each team has is $110$. Find all possible values of $n$.

Find all functions $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that
\[ f(x^{2020} +2020y) = f(x^{2021} +2021y) +f(x^{2022}) \]
for all $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$.
